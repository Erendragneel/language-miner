# Language Miner asset provenance register

This is the archived register for v6.4.138. The illustrated development build now also contains generated learning illustrations, code-native diagrams, bundled neural pronunciation recordings, and original music. Consult ARTWORK-CLUE-NOTES.md, MATCHING-ARTWORK-PROMPTS.md, NATIVE-VOICES-UPDATE.md, and MUSIC-UPDATE.md for those additions. The historical inventory below does not describe the current build’s media coverage.

Audit date: 2026-08-15  
Build reviewed: v6.4.138 legal-readiness source package

This is the release-control register for bundled art, media, fonts, datasets, and third-party code. A file may ship commercially only when its row is `CLEARED`. `HOLD` means that the product owner must attach a source file, license, commission transfer, or AI-generation record before release. This register is operational documentation, not a legal opinion.

## Release rules

- Keep the original prompt, generation date, tool terms/version, and any reference inputs for AI-assisted art.
- Do not use a third-party reference image unless its license expressly permits the intended commercial derivative use.
- Keep invoices and written copyright assignments for commissioned work.
- Record the source URL, license text, author, download date, and modifications for third-party material.
- Do not copy another learning app's illustrations, characters, layout, sounds, lesson text, or trade dress.
- Re-run this audit whenever an image, font, sound, dataset, or large encoded asset changes.

## Fonts, audio, and services

- No standalone font file (`woff`, `woff2`, `ttf`, or `otf`) was found in this package. The UI uses device/browser fonts.
- No bundled music, sound recording, or video file was found in this package.
- Speech uses device/browser Web Speech voices; it does not redistribute voice recordings.
- Supabase and Patreon are services/integrations, not bundled creative assets. Their names must remain descriptive and must not imply endorsement.

## Release decision

The source build can be tested, but it is **not art-cleared for commercial launch** while any `HOLD` item remains. The safest launch route is to replace held art with newly created, documented originals or obtain a signed chain of title for each held item.
